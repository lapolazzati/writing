# From Savings Agent to Family Financial Ally: The Evolution of Tutto a Posto to become CRESCE

## Demographic

### I From Broad Savings to Focused Finance: Our Journey

When we first conceived Tutto a Posto, we envisioned an AI savings agent that would help everyone optimize their bills and find better deals. The market for it seems interesting, there has been recent exits and seems like it's ripe for distruption, and if you look at some of those websites you truly understand that they are in need of a refresh. 

As we refined the objective, both testing specific websites with different audiences (TODO add specifics, CTA, CAC etc), and conducting deep customer research (talking to more than XYZ)

Through our interviews with potential users, parents emerged not just as a segment, but as a group with distinct, compelling needs that went far beyond simple cost-cutting. Take Daisy, a mother we interviewed. While she was actively hunting for savings—even going so far as to walk a kilometer to Penny Market without a car to save money—her real story revealed much more:
"When my child was born, we had no margin for maneuver. We had a minimal budget, so we only made essential expenses... Now the situation has changed a bit, so maybe I can put something aside for the child too. We opened an account in his name, and when I can, I put money in it."

We have Families that are cash-strapped, and with the raising inflation the number of them has increased quickly, (add numbers and details about it) but that are willing to invest, if it's for their kids. 
This pattern of trying to balance immediate savings with long-term planning repeated across our parent interviews. Another mother, Sally, showed us how parents are already creating sophisticated financial systems for their children:
"Each child has their piggy bank... they do some small jobs around the house or get pocket money... we put it there, and each one has their quota. We even have a technology-enabled safe where they can input a code and it opens with a little music."


These conversations revealed three critical insights that changed our direction:

1. Parents aren't just looking for savings—they're trying to build financial foundations for their families

2. They're actively creating informal systems to manage money across generations

3. The tools they need don't exist in an integrated way

This wasn't just about cutting costs anymore. We found out that this demographic NEEDS to save, but also wants better financial solutions. They are attempting to solve a much bigger challenge: how to manage family finances across generations, from immediate savings to long-term wealth building.
 
### The Parent Opportunity: A Demographic at an Inflection Point

Millenial Parents represent a unique combination of financial capacity, digital nativity and life stage needs. Also they are the first generation that will feel the collapse of the social state. On top of it this demographic is set to be one of the largest recipients of inherited wealth in history (TODO: add graphs) but hasn't fully felt like they are ready to take on this challenge. 

A few other facts 
- 35% of Italian Millennials (30-40) are now parents
- Peak earning years coinciding with highest expense years
- Average family spending on children: €X/year
- X% have inheritance/generational wealth to manage
- Higher propensity to invest than previous generations

Millenials are the first Digital Generation, yet they still bank, and invest with the tools and products that their parents used.
That is one of the reasons why Crypto and Bets (TODO: add source) have such a high penetration with the younger generations, they lack not only the financial literacy, but also some of the instruments. In Italy that is even more clear, there isn't an indipendent digital bank yet (TODO: Source Benedetta) and the main investment vehicle for children is the Buono Fruttifero Postale which does have great returns (TODO: Add Returns) and is also one of the investment my mom still has. 

But Millenials, and the next generation, want something easier that they can check on their phones, a few of the people we talked to mentioned that they prefer to use cards only, in order to mantain their budget better, they only use cash for savings (to put it in their salvadanaios). 

And they do their shopping online, why would they want to go to their local poste branch to invest in their kids future?

Traditional Parents → Millennial Parents
Pay in cash        → Track digitally
Single bank       → Multiple financial tools
Accept fees       → Compare actively

As daisy would say 
> "For more significant expenses that could impact our family budget later, we've opened an account in his name... this way I can manage other expenses while setting something aside for him."
