# From Savings Agent to Family Financial Ally: The Evolution of Tutto a Posto to become CRESCE



### I From Broad Savings to Focused Finance: Our Journey

When we first conceived Tutto a Posto, we envisioned an AI savings agent that would help everyone optimize their bills and find better deals. The market for it seems interesting, there has been recent exits and seems like it's ripe for distruption, and if you look at some of those websites you truly understand that they are in need of a refresh. 

As we refined the objective, both testing specific websites with different audiences (TODO add specifics, CTA, CAC etc), and conducting deep customer research (talking to more than XYZ)

Through our interviews with potential users, parents emerged not just as a segment, but as a group with distinct, compelling needs that went far beyond simple cost-cutting. Take Daisy, a mother we interviewed. While she was actively hunting for savings—even going so far as to walk a kilometer to Penny Market without a car to save money—her real story revealed much more:
"When my child was born, we had no margin for maneuver. We had a minimal budget, so we only made essential expenses... Now the situation has changed a bit, so maybe I can put something aside for the child too. We opened an account in his name, and when I can, I put money in it."

We have Families that are cash-strapped, and with the raising inflation the number of them has increased quickly, (add numbers and details about it) but that are willing to invest, if it's for their kids. 
This pattern of trying to balance immediate savings with long-term planning repeated across our parent interviews. Another mother, Sally, showed us how parents are already creating sophisticated financial systems for their children:
"Each child has their piggy bank... they do some small jobs around the house or get pocket money... we put it there, and each one has their quota. We even have a technology-enabled safe where they can input a code and it opens with a little music."


These conversations revealed three critical insights that changed our direction:

1. Parents aren't just looking for savings—they're trying to build financial foundations for their families

2. They're actively creating informal systems to manage money across generations

3. The tools they need don't exist in an integrated way

This wasn't just about cutting costs anymore. We were watching parents attempt to solve a much bigger challenge: how to manage family finances across generations, from immediate savings to long-term wealth building.
